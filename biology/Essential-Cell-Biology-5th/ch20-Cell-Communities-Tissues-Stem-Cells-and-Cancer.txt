CHAPTER 20 Cell Communities: Tissues, Stem Cells, and Cancer

EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX AND CONNECTIVE TISSUES

    Plant Cells Have Tough External Walls

    Cellulose Microfibrils Give the Plant Cell Wall Its Tensile Strength

    Animal Connective Tissues Consist Largely of Extracellular Matrix

    Collagen Provides Tensile Strength in Animal Connective Tissues

    Cells Organize the Collagne They Secrete

    Integrins Couple the Matrix Outside a Cell to the Cytoskeleton Inside it

    Gels of Polysaccharides and Proteins Fill Spaces and Resist Compression

EPITHELIAL SHEETS AND CELL JUNCTIONS

    Epithelial Sheets Are Polarized and Rest on a Basal Lamina

    Tight Junctions Make an Epithelium Leakproof and Separate Its Apical and
    Basolateral Surfaces

    Cytoskeleton-linked Junctions Bind Epithelial Cells Robustly to One 
    Another and to the Basal Lamina

    Gap Junctions Allow Cytosolic Inorganic Ions and Small Molecules to Pass
    from Cell to Cell

STEM CELLS AND TISSUE RENEWAL

    Tissues Are Organized Mixtures of Many Cell Types

    Different Tissues Are Renewed at Different Rates

    Stem Cells and Proliferating Precursor Cells Generate a Continuous Supply
    of Terminally Differentiated Cells

    Specific Signals Maintain Stem-Cell Populations

    Stem Cells Can Be Used to Repair Lost or Damaged Tissues

    Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Provide a Convenient Source of Human ES-like
    Cells

    Mouse and Human Pluripotent Stem Cells Can Form Organoids in Culture

CANCER

    Cancer Cells Proliferate Excessively and Migrate Inappropriately

    Epidemiological Studies Identify Preventable Causes of Cancer

    Cancers Develop by an Accumulation of Somatic Mutations

    Cancer Cells Evolve, Acquiring an Increasing Competitive Advantage

    Two Main Classes of Genes Are Critical for Cancer: Oncogenes and Tumor
    Suppressor Genes

    Cancer-critical Mutations Cluster in a Few Fundamental Pathways

    Colorectal Cancer Illustrates How Loss of a Tumor Suppressor Gene Can 
    Lead to Cancer

    An Understanding of Cancer Cell Biology Opens the Way to New Treatments
