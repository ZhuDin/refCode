CHAPTER 2 Chemical Components of Cells

CHEMICAL BONDS

    Cells Are Made of Relatively Few Types of Atoms

    The Outermost Electrons Determine How Atoms Interact

    Covalent Bonds Forms by the Sharing of Electrons

    Some Covalent Bonds Involve More Than One Electron Pair

    Electrons in Covalent Bonds Are Often Shared Unequally

    Covalent Bonds Are Strong Enought to Survive the Conditions Inside Cells

    Ionic Bonds Form Are Important Noncovalent Bonds for Many Biological 
    Molecules

    Four Types of Weak Interactions Help Bring Molecules Together in Cells

    Some Polar Molecules Form Acids and Bases in Water

SMALL MOLECULES IN CELLS

    A Cell Is Formed from Carbon Compounds

    Cells Contain Four Major Families of Small Organic Molecules

    Sugars Are both Energy Sources and Subunits of Polysaccharides

    Fatty Acids Are the Subunits of Proteins

    Nucleotides Are the Subunits of DNA and RNA

MACROMOLECULES IN CELLS

    Each Macromolecule Contains a Specific Sequence of Subunits

    Noncovalent Bonds Specify the Precise Shape of a Macromolecule

    Noncovalent Bonds Allow a Macromolecule to Bind Other Selected Molecules
