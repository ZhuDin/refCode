CHAPTER 19 Sexual Reproduction and Genetics

THE BENEFITS OF SEX

    Sexual Reproduction Involves both Diploid and Haploid Cells

    Sexual Reproduction Generates Genetic Diversity

    Sexual Reproduction Gives Organisms a Competitive Advantage in a 
    Changing Environment

MEIOSIS AND FERTILIZATION

    Meiosis Involves One Round of DNA Replication Followed by Two Rounds of
    Nuclear Division

    Duplicated Homologous Chromosomes Pair During Meiotic Prophase

    Crossing-Over Occurs Between the Duplicated Maternal and Paternal 
    Chromosomes in Each Bivalent

    Chromosome Pairing and Crossing-Over Ensure the Proper Segregation of 
    Homologs

    The Second Meiotic Division Produces Haploid Daughter Nuclei

    Haploid Gametes Contain Reassorted Genetic Information

    Meiosis Is Not Flawless

    Fertilization Reconstitutes a Complete Diploid Genome

MENDEL AND THE LAWS OF INHERITANCE

    Mendel Studied Traits That Are Inherited in a Discrete Fashion

    Mendel Disproved the Alternative Theories of Inheritance

    Mendel's Experiments Revealed the Existence of Dominant and Recessive 
    Alleles

    Each Gamete Carries a Single Allele for Each Character

    Mendel's Law of Segregation Applies to All Sexually Reproducing Organisms

    Alleles for Different Traits Segregate Independently

    The Behavior of Chromosomes During Meiosis Underlies Mendel's Laws of 
    Inheritance

    Genes That Lie on the Same Chromosome Can Segregate Independently by 
    Crossing-Over

    Mutations in Genes Can Cause a Loss of Function or a Gain of Function

    Each of Us carries Many Potentially Harmful Recessive Mutations

GENETICS AS AN EXPERIMENTAL TOOL

    The Classical Genetic Approach Begins with Random Mutagenesis

    Genetic Screens Identify Mutants Deficient in Specific Cell Processes

    Conditional Mutants Permit the Study of Lethal Mutations

    A Complementation Test Reveals Whether Two Mutations Are in the Same Gene

EXPLORING HUMAN GENETICS

    Linked Blocks of Polymorphisms Have Been Passed Down from Our Ancestors

    Polymorphisms Provide Clues to Our Evolutionary History

    Genetic Studies Aid in the Search for the Causes of Human Diseases

    Many Severe, Rare Human Disease Are Caused by Mutations in Single Genes

    Common Human Diseases Are Often Influenced by Multiple Mutations and 
    Envrionmental Factors

    Geneme-wide Association Studies Can Aid the Search for Mutations 
    Associated with Disease

    We Still Have Much to Learn about the Genetic Basis of Human Variation and
    Disease
