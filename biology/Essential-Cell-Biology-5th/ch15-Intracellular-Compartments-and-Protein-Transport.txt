CHAPTER 15 Intracellular Compartments and Protein Transport

MEMBRANE-ENCLOSED ORGANELLES

    Eukayotic Cells Contain a Basic Set of Membrane-enclosed Organelles

    Membrane-enclosed Organelles Evolved in Different Ways

PROTEIN SORTING

    Proteins Are Transported into Organelles by Three Mechanisms

    Signal Sequences Direct Proteins to the Correct Compartment

    Proteins Enter the Nucleus Through Nuclear Pores

    Proteins Unfold to Enter Mitochondria and Chloroplasts

    Proteins Enter Peroxisomes from both the Cytosol and the Endoplasmic 
    Reticulum

    Proteins Enter the Endoplasmic Reticulum While Being Synthesized

    Soluble Proteins Made on the EP Are Released into the ER Lumen

    Start and Stop Signals Determine the Arrangement of a Transmembrane Protein
    in the Lipid Bilayer

VESICULAR TRANSPORT

    Transport Vesicles Carry Soluble Proteins and Membrane Between Compartments

    Vesicle Budding Is Driven by the Assembly of a Protein Coat

    Vesicle Docking Depends on Tethers and SNAREs

SECRETORY PATHWAYS

    Most Proteins Are Covalently Modified in the ER

    Exit from the ER Is Controlled to Ensure Protein Quality

    The Size of the ER Is Controlled by the Demand for Protein Folding

    Proteins Are Further Modified and Sorted in the Golgi Apparatus

    Secretory Proteins Are Released from the Cell by Exocytosis

ENDOCYTIC PATHWAYS

    Specialized Phagocytic Cells Ingest Large Particles

    Fluid and Macromolecules Are Taken Up by Pinocytosis

    Recepto-mediated Endocytosis Provides a Specific Route into Animal Cells

    Endocytosed Macromolecules Are Sorted in Endosomes

    Lysosomes Are the Pricipal Sites of Intracellular Digestion
