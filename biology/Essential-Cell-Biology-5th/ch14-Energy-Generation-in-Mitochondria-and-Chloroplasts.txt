CHAPTER 14 Energy Generation in Mitochondria and Chloroplasts

    Cells Obtain Most of Their Energy by a Membrane-based Mechanism

    Chemiosmotic Coupling Is an Ancient Process, Preserved in Present-Day Cells

MITOCHONDRIA AND OXIDATIVE Phosphorylation

    Mitochondria Are Dynamic in Structure, Location, and Number

    A Mitochondrion Contains an Outer Membrane, an Inner Membrane, and Two 
    Internal Compartments

    The Citric Acid Cycle Generates High-Energy Electrons Required for ATP 
    Production

    The Movement of Electrons Is Coupled to the Pumping of Protons

    Electrons Pass Through Three Large Enzyme Complexes in the Inner 
    Mitochondrial Membrane

    Proton Pumping Produces a Steep Electrochemical Proton Gradient Across
    the Inner Mitochondrial Membrane

    ATP Synthase Uses the Energy Stored in the Electrochemical Proton Gradient
    to Produce ATP

    The Electrochemical Proton Gradient Also Drives Transport Across the Inner
    Mitochondrial Membrane

    The Rapid Conversion of ADP to ATP in Mitochondria Maintains a High ATP/ADP
    Ratio in Cells

    Cell Respiration Is Amazingly Efficient

MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF ELECTRON TRANSPORT AND PROTON PUMPING

    Protons Are Readily Moved by the Transfer of Electrons

    The Redox Potential Is a Measure of Electron Affinities

    Electron Transfers Release Large Amounts of Energy

    Metals Tightly Bound to Proteins Form Versatile Electron Carriers

    Cytochrome c Oxidase Catalyzes the Reduction of Molecular Oxygen

CHLOROPLASTS AND PHOTOSYNTHESIS

    Chloroplasts Resemble Mitochondria But Have an Extra Compartment--the 
    Thylakoid

    Photosynthesis Generate--and Then Consumes--ATP and NADPH

    Chlorophyll Molecules Absorb the Energy of Sunlight

    Excited Chlorophyll Molecules Funnel Energy into a Reaction Center

    A Pair of Photosystems Cooperate to Generate both ATP and NADPH

    Oxygen Is GEnerated by a Water-Splitting Complex Associated with 
    Photosystem II

    The Special Pair in Photosystem I Receives its Electrons from Photosystem II

    Carbon Fixation Uses ATP and NADPH to Convert CO[2] into Sugars

    Sugars Generated by Carbon Fixation Can Be Stored as Strarch or Consumed to 
    Produce ATP

THE EVOLUTION OF ENERGY-GENERATING SYSTEMS

    Oxidative Phosphorylation Evolved in Stages

    Photosynthetic Bacteria Made Even Fewer Demands on Their Environment

    The Lifestyle of Methanococcus Suggests That Chemiosmotic Coupling Is an 
    Ancient Process
