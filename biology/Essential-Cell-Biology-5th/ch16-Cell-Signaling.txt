CHAPTER 16 Cell Signaling

GENEAL PRINCIPLES OF CELL SIGNALING

    Signals Can Act over a Long or Short Range

    A Limited Set of Extracellular Signals Can Produce a Huge Variety of 
    Cell Behaviors

    A Cell's Response to a Signal Can Be Fast or Slow

    Cell-Surface Receptors Relay Extracellular Signals via Intracellular 
    Signaling Pathways

    Some Intracellular Signaling Proteins Act as Molecular Switches

    Cell-Surface Receptors Fall into Three Main Classes

    Ion-Channel-Coupled Receptors Convert Chemical Signals into Electrical Ones

G-PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS

    Stimulation of GPCRs Activates G-Protein Subunits

    Some Bacterial Toxins Cause Disease by Altering the Activity of G Proteins

    Some G Proteins Directly Regulate Ion Channels

    Many G Proteins Activate Membrane-bound Enzymes That Produce Samll
    Messenger Molecules

    The Cyclic AMP Signaling Pathway Can Activate Enzymes and Turn On Genes

    The Inositol Phospholipid Pathway Triggers a Rise in Intracllular Ca<2+>

    A Ca<2+> Signal Triggers Many Biological Processes

    A GPCR Signaling Pathway Generates a Dissolved Gas That Carries a Signal
    to Adjacent Cells

    GPCR-Triggered Intracellular Signaling Cascades Can Achieve Astonishing
    Speed, Sensitivity, and Adaptability

ENZYME-COUPLED RECEPTORS

    Activated RTKs Recruit a Complex lf Intracellular Signaling Proteins

    Most RTKs Activate the Monomeric GTPase Ras

    RTKs Activate PI 3-Kinase to Produce Lipid Docking Sites in the Plasma
    Membrane

    Some Receptors Activate a Fast Track to the Nucleus

    Some Extracellular Signal Molecules Cross the Plasma Membrane and Bind to 
    Intracellur Receptors

    Plant Make Use of Receptors and Signaling Strategies That Differ from Those
    Used by Animals

    Protein Kinase Networks Integrate Information to Control Complex Cell 
    Behaviors
