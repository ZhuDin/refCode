CHAPTER 1 Cells: The Fundamental Units of Life 

UNITY AND DIVERSITY OF CELLS

    Cells Vary Enormously in Appearance and Function

    Living Cells All Have a Similar Basic Chemistry

    Living Cells Are Self-Replicating Collections of Catalysts

    All Living Cells Have Apparently Evolved from the Same Ancestral Cell

    Genes Provide Instructions for the Form, Function, and Behavior of Cells 
    and Organisms

CELLS UNDER THE MICROSCOPE

    The Invention of the Light Microscope Led to the Discovery of Cells

    Light Microscopes Reveal Some of a Cell's Components

    The Fine Structure of a Cell Is Revealed by Electron Microscopy

The PROKARYOTIC CELL

    Prokaryotes Are the Most Diverse and Numerous Cells on Earth

    The World of Prokaryotes Is Divided into Two Domains: Bacteria and Archaea

THE EUKARYOTIC CELL

    The Nucleus Is the Information Store of the Cell

    Mitochondria Generate Usable Energy from Food Molecules

    Chloroplasts Capture Energy from Sunlight

    Internal Membranes Create Instracellular Compartments with Different 
    Fuctions

    The Cytosol Is a Concentrated Aqueous Gel of Large and Small Molecules

    The Cytoskeleton Is Responsible for Directed Cell Movements

    The Cytosol Is Far from Static

    Eukaryotic Cells May Have Originated as Predators

MODEL ORGANISMS

    Molecular Biologists Have Focused on E. coli

    Brewer's Yeast Is a Simple Eukaryote

    Arabidopsis Has Been Chosen as a Model Plant

    Model Animals Include Flies, Worms, Fish, and Mice

    Biologists Also Directly Study Humans and Their Cells

    Comparing Genome Sequences Reveals Life's Common Heritage

    Genomes Contain More Then Just Genes
