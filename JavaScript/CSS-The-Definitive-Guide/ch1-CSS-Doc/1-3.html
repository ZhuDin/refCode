    <h1>Waffles!</h1>
    <p style='color: gray'>The most wonderful of all breakfast foods is 
    the waffle--a ridged and cratered slab of home-cooked, fluffy goodness
    that makes every child's heart soar with joy. And they're so easy to make!
    Just a simple waffle-maker and some batter, and you're ready for a morning 
    of aromatic ecstasy!
