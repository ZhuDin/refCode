CHAPTER 9 How Genes and Genomes Evolve

GENERATING GENTETIC VARIATION

    In Secually Reproducing Organisms, Only Changes to the Germ Line Are Passed
    On to Progeny

    Point Mutations Are Caused by Failures of the Normal Mechanisms
    for Copying and Repairing DNA

    Mutations Can Also Change the Regulation of a Gene

    DNA Duplications Give Rise to Families of Related Genes

    Duplication and Divergence Produced the Globin Gene Family

    Whole-Genome Duplications Have Shaped the Evolutionary History of Many 
    Species

    Novel Genes Can Be Created by Exon Shuffling

    The Evolution of Genomes Has Been Profoundly Influenced by Mobile Genetic
    Elements

    Genes Can Be Exchanged Between Organisms by Horizontal Gene Transfer

RECONSTRUCTING LIFE'S FAMILY TREE

    Genetic Changes That Provide a Selective Advantage Are Likely to Be 
    Preserved

    Closely Related Organisms Have Genomes That Are Similar in Organization
    as Well as Sequence

    Functionally Important Genome Regions Show Up as Islands of Conserved DNA
    Sequence

    Genome Comparisons Show That Vertebrate Genomes Gain and Lose DNA Papidly

    Sequence Conservation Allows Us to Trace Even the Most Distant Evolutionary
    Relationships

MOBILE GENETIC ELEMENTS AND VIRUSES

    Mobile Genetic Elements Encode the Comonents They Need for Movement

    The Human Genome Contains Two Major Families of Transposable Sequences

    Viruses Can Move Between Cells and Organisms

    Retroviruses Reverse the Normal Flow of Genetic Information

EXAMINING THE HUMAN GENOME

    The Nucleotide Sequences of Human Genomes Show How Our Genes Are Arranged

    Differences in Gene Regulation May Help Explain How Animals with Similar
    Genomes Can Be So Different

    The Genome of Extinct Neanderthals Reveals Much about What Makes Us Human

    Genome Variation Contributes to Our Individuality--But How?
