CHAPTER 8 Control of Gene Expression

AN OVERVIEW OF GENE EXPRESSION

    The Different Cell Types of a Multicellular Organis Contains the Same DNA

    Different Cell Types Produce Different Sets of Proteins

    A Cell Can Change the Expression of Its Genes in Response to External 
    Signals

    Gene Expression Can be Regulated at Various Steps from DNA to RNA to Protein

HOW TRANSCRIPTION IS REGULATED

    Transcription Regulators Bind to Regulatory DNA Sequences

    Transcription Switches Allow Cells to Respond to Changes in Their
    Environment

    Repressors Turn Genes Off and Activators Turn Them On 

    The Lac Operon Is Controlled by an Activator and a Repressor

    Eukaryotic Transcription Regulators Control Gene Expression from a Distance

    Eukaryotic Transcription Regulators Help Initiate Transcription by 
    Recruiting Chromatin-Modifying Proteins

    The Arrangement of Chromosomes into Looped Domains Keeps Enhancers in Check

GENERATING SPECIALIZED CELL TYPES

    Eukaryotic Genes Are Controlled by Combinations of Transcription Regulators

    The Expression of Different Genes Can Be Coordinated by a Single Protein

    Combinatorial Control Can Also Generate Different Cell Types

    The Formation of an Entire Organ Can Be Triggered by a Single Transcription
    Regulator

    Transcription Regulators Can Be Used to Experimentally Direct the Formation
    of Specific Cell Types in Culture

    Differentiated Cells Maintain Their Identity

POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL CONTROLS

    mRNAs Contains Sequences That Control Their Translation

    Regulatory RNAs Control the Expression of Thousands of Genes

    MicroRNAs Direct the Destruction of Target mRNAs

    Small Interfering RNAs Protect Cells From Infections

    Thousands of Long Noncoding RNAs May Also Regulate Mammalian Gene Activity
