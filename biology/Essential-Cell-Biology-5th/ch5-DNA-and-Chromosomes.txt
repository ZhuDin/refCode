CHAPTER 5 DNA AND Chromosomes

THE STRUCTURE OF DNA

    A DNA Molecule Consists of Two Complementary Chains of Nucleotides

    The Structure of DNA Provides a Mechanism for Heredity

THE STRUCTURE OF EUKARYOTIC CHROMOSOMES

    Eukaryotic DNA is Packaged into Multiple Chromosomes

    Chromosomes Organize and Carry Genetic Information

    Specialized DNA Sequences Are Required for DNA Replication and Chromosomes
    Segregation
    
    Interphase Chromosomes Are Not Randomly Distributed Within the Nucleus

    The DNA in Chromosomes Is Always Highly Condensed

    Nucleosomes Are the Basic Units of Eukaryotic Chromosome Structure

    Chromosome Packing Occurs on Multiple Levels

THE REGULATION OF CHROMOSOME STRUCTURE

    Changes in Nucleosome Structure Allow Access to DNA

    Interphase Chromosomes Contain both Hightly Condensed and More Extended
    Forms of Chromatiin

ESSENTIAL CONCEPTS

How We Know: Genes Are Made of DNA
