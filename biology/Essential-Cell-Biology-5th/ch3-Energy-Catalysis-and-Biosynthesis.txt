CHAPTER 3 Energy, Catalysis, and Biosynthesis

THE USE OF ENERGY BY CELLS

    Biological Order Is Made Possible by the Release of Heat Energy from Cells

    Cells Can Convert Energy from One Form to Another

    Photosynthetic Organisms Use Sunlight to Synthesize Organic Molecules

    Cells Obtain Energy by the Oxidation of Organic Molecules

    Oxidation and Reduction Involve Electron Transfers

FREE ENERGY AND CATALYSIS

    Chemical Reactions Proceed in the Direction That Causes a Loss of Free
    Energy

    Enzymes Reduce the Energy Needed to Initiate Spontaneous Reactions

    The Free-Energy Change for a Reaction Determines Whether It Can Occur

    △G Changes as a Reaction Proceeds Toward Equilibrium

    The Standard Free-Energy Change, △G°, Makes It Possible to Compare the 
    Energetics of Different Reactions

    The Equilibrium Constant Is Directly Proportional to △G°

    In Complex Reactions, the Equlibrium Constant Includes the Concentrations
    of All Reactants and Products

    The Equilibrium Constant Also Indicates the Strength of Noncovalent
    Binding Interactions

    For Sequential Reactions, the Changes in Free Energy Are Additive

    Enzyme-catalyzed Reactions Depend on Rapid Molecular Collisions

    Noncovalent Interactions Allow Enzymes to Bind Specific Molecules

ACTIVATED CARRIERS AND BIOSYNTHESIS

    The Formation of an Activated Carrier Is Coupled to an Energetically 
    Favorable Reaction

    ATP Is the most Widely Used Activated Carrier

    Energy Stored in ATP Is Often Harnessed to Join Two Molecules Together

    NADH and NADPH Are Both Activated Carriers of Electrons

    NADPH and NADH Have Different Roles in Cells

    Cells Make Use of Many Other Activated Carriers

    The Synthesis of Biological Polymers Requires an Energy Input
