CHAPTER 6 DNA Replication and Repair

DNA REPLICATION

    Base-Pairing Enables DNA Replication

    DNA Synthesis Begins at Replication Origins

    Two Replication Forks Form at Each Replication Origin

    DNA Polymerase Synthesizes DNA Using a Parental Strand as a Template

    The Replication Fork Is Asymmetrical

    DNA Polymerase Is Self-correcting

    Short Lengths of RNA Act as Primers for DNA Synthesis

    Proteins at a Replication Fork Cooperate to Form a Replication Machine

    Telomerase Replicates the Ends of Eukaryotic Chromosomes

    Telomere Length Varies by Cell Type and with Age

DNA REPAIR

    DNA Damage Occurs Continually in Cells

    Cells Possess a Variety of Mechanisms for Repairing DNA

    A DNA Mismatch Repair System Removes Replication Errors That Escape 
    Proofreading

    Double-Strand DNA Breaks Require a Different Strategy for Repair

    Homologous Recombination Can Flawlessly Repair DNA Double-Strand Breaks

    Failure to Repair DNA Damage Can Have Severe Consequences for a Cell or
    Organism

    A Record of the Fidelity of DNA Replication and Repair Is Preserved in
    Genome Sequences
