CHAPTER 18 The Cell-Division Cycle

OVERVIEW OF THE CELL CYCLE

    The Eukaryotic Cell Cycle Usually Includes Four Phases

    A Cell-Cycle Control System Triggers the Major Processes of the Cell Cycle

    Cell-Cycle Control Is Similar in All Eukaryotes

THE CELL-CYCLE CONTROL SYSTEM

    The Cell-Cycle Control System Depends on Cyclically Activated Protein
    Kinases Called Cdks

    Different Cyclin-Cdk Complexes Trigger Different Steps in the Cell Cycle

    Cyclin Concentrations Are Regulated by Transcription and by Proteolysis

    The Activity of Cyclin-Cdk Complexes Depends on Phosphorylation and
    Dephosphorylation

    Cdk Activity Can Be Blocked by Cdk Inhibitor Proteins

    The Cell-Cycle Control System Can Pause the Cycle in Various Ways

G[1] PHASE

    Ckds Are Stably Inactivated in G[1]

    Mitogens Promote the Production of the Cyclins That Stimulate Cell Division

    DNA Damage Can Temporarily Half Progression Throught G[1]

    Cells Can Delay Division for Prolonged Periods by Entering Specialized 
    Nondividing States

S PHASE

    S-Cdk Initiates DNA Replication and Blocks Re-Replication

    Incomplete Replication Can Arrest the Cell Cycle in G[2]

M PHASE

    M-Cdk Drives Entry into Mitosis

    Cohesins and Condensins Help Configure Duplicated Chromosomes for 
    Separation

    Different Cytoskeletal Assemblies Carry Out Mitosis and Cytokinesis

    M Phase Occurs in Stages

MITOSIS

    Centrosomes Duplicate to Help Form the Two Poles of the Mitotic Spindle

    The Mitotic Spindle Starts to Assemble in Prophase

    Chromosomes Attach to the Mitotic Spindle at Prometaphase

    Chromosomes Assist in the Assembly of the Mitotic Spindle

    Chromosomes Line Up at the Spindle Equator at Metaphase

    Proteolysis Triggers Sister-Chromatid Separation at Anaphase

    Chromosomes Segregate During Anaphase

    An Unattached Chromosome Will Prevent Sister-Chromatid Separation

    The Nuclear Envelope Re-forms at Telophase

CYTOKINESIS

    The Mitotic Spindle Determines the Plane of Cytoplasmic Cleavage

    The Contractile Ring of Animal Cells Is Made of Actin and Myosin Filaments

    Cytokinesis in Plant Cells Involves the Formation of a New Cell Wall

    Membrane-enclosed Organelles Must Be Distributed to Daughter Cells When a
    Cell Divides

CONTROL OF CELL NUMBERS ADN CELL SIZE

    Apoptosis Helps Regulate Animal Cell Numbers

    Apoptosis Is Mediated by an Intracellular Proteolytic Cascade

    The Intrinsic Apoptotic Death Program Is Regulated by the Bcl2 Family of
    Intracellular Proteins

    Apoptotic Signals Can Also Come from Other Cells

    Animal Cells Require Extracellular Signals to Survive, Grow, and Divide

    Survival Factors Suppress Apoptosis

    Mitogens Stimulate Cell Division by Promoting Entry into S Phase

    Growth Factors Stimulate Cells to Grow

    Some Extracellular Signal Proteins Inhibit Cell Survival, Division, or 
    Growth
