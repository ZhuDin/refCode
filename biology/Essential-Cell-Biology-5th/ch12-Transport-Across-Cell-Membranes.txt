CHAPTER 12 Transport Across Cell Membranes

PRINCIPLES OF TRANSMEMBRANE TRANSPORT

    Lipid Bilayers Are Impereable to Ions and Most Uncharged Polar Molecules

    The Ion Concentrations Inside a Cell Are Very Different from Those
    Outside

    Differences in Concentration of Inorganic Ions Across a Cell Membrane
    Create a Membrane Potential

    Cells Contain Two Classes of Membrane Transport Proteins: Transports and
    Channels

    Solutes Cross Membranes by Either Passive or Active Transport

    Both the Concentration Gradient and Membrane Poteintial Influence the 
    Passive Transport of Charged Solutes

    Water Moves Across Cell Membranes Down Its Concentration Gradient--a
    Process Called Osmosis

TRANSPORTERS AND THEIR FUNCTIONS

    Passive Trnasporters Move a Solute Along Its Electrochemical Gradient

    Pumps Actively Transport a Solute Against Its Electrochemical Gradient

    The Na+ Pump in Animal Cells Uses Energy Supplied by ATP to Expel Na+ and
    Bring in K+

    The Na+ Pumb Generates a Steep Concentration Gradient of Na+ Across the 
    Plasma Membrane

    Ca<2+> Pumps Keep the Cytosolic Ca<2+> Concentration Low

    Gradient-driven Pumps Exploit Solute gradients to Mediate Active Transport

    The Electrochemical Na+ Gradient Drives the Transport of Glucose Across
    the Plasma Membrane of Animal Cells

    Electrochemical H+ Gradients Drive the Transport of Solutes in Plants, 
    Fungi, and Bacteria

ION CHANNELS AND THE MEMBRANE POTENTIAL

    Ion Channels Are Ion-selective and Gated

    Membrane Potential Is Governed by the Permeability of a Membrane to 
    Specific Ions

    Ion Channels Randomly Snap Between Open and Closed States

    Different Types of Stimuli Influence the Opening and Closing of Ion Channels

    Voltage-gated Ion Channels Respond to the Membrane Potential

ION CHANNELS AND NERVE CELL SIGNALING

    Action Potentials Allow Rapid Long-Distance Communication Along Axons

    Aciton Potentials Are Mediated by Voltage-gated Cation Channels

    Voltage-gated Ca<2+> Channels in Nerve Terminals Convert an Electrical 
    Signal into a Chemical Signal

    Transmitter-gated Ion Channels in the Postsynaptic Membrane Convert the 
    Chemical Signal Back into an Electrical Signal

    Neurotransmitters Can Be Excitatory or Inhibitory

    Most Psychoactive Drugs Affect Synaptic Signaling by Binding to 
    Neurotransmitter Receptors

    The Complexity of Synaptic Signaling Enables Us to Think, Act, Learn, and 
    Remember

    Light-gated Ion Channels Can Be Used to Transiently Activate or Inactivate
    Neurons in Living Animals
