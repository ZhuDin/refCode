CHAPTER 17 Cytoskeleton

INTERMEDIATE FILAMENETS

    Intermediate Filaments Are Strong and Ropelike

    Intermediate Filaments Strengthen Cells Against Mechanical Stress

    The Nuclear Envelope Is Supported by a Meshwork of Intermediate Filaments

    Linker Proteins Connect Cytoskeletal Filaments and Bridge the Nuclear
    Envelope

MICROTUBULES

    Microtubules Are Hollow Tubes with Structurally Distinct Ends

    The Centrosome Is the Major Microtuble-organizing Center in Animal Cells

    Microtubules Display Dynamic Instability

    Dynamic Instability Is Driven by GTP Hydrolysis

    Microtubule Dynamics Can Be Modified by Drugs

    Microtubules Organize the Cell Interior

    Motor Proteins Drive Intracellular Transport

    Microtubules and Motor Proteins Position Organelles in the Cytoplasm

    Cilia and Flagella Contain Stable Microtubules Moved by Dynein

ACTIN FILAMENTS

    Actin Filaments Are Thin and Flexible

    Actin and Tubulin Polymerize by Similar Mechanisms

    Many Proteins Bind to Actin and Modify Its Properties

    A Cortex Rich in Action Filaments Underlies the Plasma Membrane of Most
    Eukaryotic Cells

    Cell Crawling Depends on Cortical Action

    Actin-binding Proteins Influence the Type of Protrusions Formed at the 
    Leading Edge

    Extracellular Signals Can Alter the Arrangement of Actin Filaments

    Actin Associates with Myosin to Form Contractile Structures

MUSCLE CONTRACTION

    Muscle Contraction Depends on Interacting Filaments of Actin and Myosin

    Actin Filaments Slide Against Myosin Filaments During Muscle Contraction

    Muscle Contraction Is Triggered by a Sudden Rise in Cytosolic Ca<2+>

    Different Types of Muscle Perform Different Functions
