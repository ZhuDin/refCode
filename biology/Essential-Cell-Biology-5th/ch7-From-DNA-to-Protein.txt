CHAPTER 7 From DNA to Protein: How Cells Read the Genome

FROM DNA TO RNA

    Portions of DNA Sequence Are Transcribed into RNA

    Transcription Produces RNA That Is Complementary to One Strand of DNA

    Cells Produce Various Types of RNA

    Signals in the DNA Tell RNA Polymerase Where to Start and Stop Transcription

    Initiation of Eukaryotic Gene Transcription Is a Complex Process

    Eukaryotic RNA Polymerase Requires General Transcription Factors

    Eukaryotic mRNAs Are Processed in the Nucleus

    In Eukaryotes, Protein-Coding Genes Are Interrupted by Noncoding Sequences
    Called Introns

    Introns Are Removed from Pre-mRNAs by RNS Splicing

    RNA Synthesis and Processing Takes Place in "Factories" Within the Nucleus

    Mature Eukaryotic mRNAs Are Exported from the Nucleus

    mRNA Molecules Are Eventually Degraded in the Cytosol

FROM RNA TO PROTEIN

    An mRNASequence Is Decoded in Sets of Three Nucleotides

    tRNA Molecules Match Amino Acids to Codons in mRNA

    Specific Enzymes Couple tRNAs to the Correct Amino Acid

    The mRNA Message Is Decoded on Ribosomes

    The Ribosome Is a Ribozyme

    Specific Codons in an mRNA Signal the Ribosome Where to Start and to Stop
    Protein Synthesis

    Proteins Are Produced on Polyribosomes

    Inhibitors of Prokaryotic Protein Synthesis Are Used as Antibiotics

    Controlled Protein Breakdown Helps Regulate the Amount of Each Protein 
    in a Cell

    There Are Many Steps Between DNA and Protein

RNA AND THE ORIGINS OF LIFE

    Life Requires Autocatalysis

    RNA Can Store Information and Catalyze Chemical Reactions

    RNA Is Thought to Predate DNA in Evolution
