CHAPTER 11 Membrane Structure

THE LIPID BILAYER

    Membrane Lipids Form Bilayers in Water

    The Lipid Bilayer Is a Flexible Two-dimensional Fluid

    The Fluidity of a Lipid Bilayer Depends on Its Composition

    Membrane Assembly Begins in the ER

    Certain Phospholipids Are Confined to One Side of the Membrane

MEMBRANE PROTEINS

    Membrane Proteins Associate with the Lipid Bipid Bilayer in Different Ways

    A Polypeptide Chain Usually Crosses the Lipid Bilayer as an É‘ Helix

    Membrane Proteins Can Be Solubilized in Detergents

    We Know the Complete Structure of Relatively Few Membrane Proteins

    The Plasma Membrane Is Reinforced by the Underlying Cell Cortex

    A Cell Can Restrict the Movement of Its Membrane Proteins

    The Cell Surface Is Coated with Carbohydrate
