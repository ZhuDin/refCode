CHAPTER 4 Protein Structure and Function

THE SHAPE AND STRUCTURE OF PROTEINS

    The Shape of a Protein Is Specified by Its Amino Acid Sequence

    Proteins Fold into a Conformation of Lowest Energy

    Proteins Come in a Wide Variety of Complicated Shapes

    The ɑ Helix and the ß Sheet Are Common Folding Patterns

    Helices Form Readily in Biological Structures

    ß Sheets Form Regid Structures at the Core of Mnay Proteins

    Misfolded Proteins Can Form Amyloid Structures That Cause Disease

    Proteins Have Several Levels of Organization

    Proteins Also Contain Unstructured Regions

    Few of the Many Possible Polypeptide Chains Will Be Useful

    Proteins Can Be Classified into Families

    Large Protein Molecules Often Contain More than One Polypeptide Chain

    Proteins Can Assemble into Filaments, Sheets, or Spheres

    Some Types of Proteins Have Elongated Fibrous Shapes

    Extracellular Proteins Are Often Stabilized by Covalent Cross-Linkages

HOW PROTEINS WORK

    All Proteins Bind to Other Molecules

    Humans Produce Billions of Different Antibodies, Each with a Different 
    Binding Site

    Enzymes Are Powerful and Highly Specific Catalysts

    Enzymes Greatly Accelerate the Speed of Chemical Reactions

    Lysozyme Illustrates How an Enzyme Works

    Many Drugs Inhibit Enzymes

    Tightly Bound Small Molecules Add Extra Functions to Proteins

HOW PROTEINS ARE CONTROLLED

    The Catalytic Activities of Enzymes Are Often Regulated by Other Molecules

    Allosteric Enzymes Have Two or More Binding Sites That Influence One Another

    Phosphorylation Can Control Protein Activity by Causing a Conformational
    Change

    Covalent Modifications Also Control the Location and Interaction of Proteins

    Regulatory GTP-Binding Proteins Are Switched On and Off by the Gain and Loss
    of a Phosphate Group

    ATP Hydrolysis Allows Motor Proteins to Produce Directed Movements in Cells

    Proteins Often Form Large Complexes That Function as Machines

    Many Interacting Proteins Are Brought Together by Scaffolds

    Weak Interactions Between Macromolecules Can Produce Large Biochemical 
    Subcompartments in Cells

HOW PROTEINS ARE STUDIED

    Proteins Can Be Purified from Cells or Tissues

    Determining a Protein's Structure Begins with Determining Its Amino Acid
    Sequence

    Genetic Engineering Techniques Permit the Large-Scale Production, Design,
    and Analysis of Almost Any Protein

    The Relatedness of Proteins Aids the Prediction of Protein Structure and 
    Function
